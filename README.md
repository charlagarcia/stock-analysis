# An Analysis of Stocks
Explore green energy stock performance by analyzing financial data using VBA.  

## Overview of Project
1. Create a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells.
2. Use for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.
3. Use nested for loops.
4. Apply coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.

### Purpose
Steve's parents have decided to invest all of their money into DAQO New Energy Corp. 
We needed to find out if this was a worthy investment, or if there was another green energy company that would be more profitable.

We then refactored the code to run more efficiently.

## Results

### Comparing original analysis run times vs refactored
The original code ran in approximately .4 seconds for each year.

After refactoring, run times were significantly reduced.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   - Launching in the Spring is ideal.
   - There is minimal risk of cancelation throughout the year. However, December is the least successful month.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  The most successful ranges are $0 - $20,000 and $35,000 - $45,000.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Information on canceled plays is not available for October.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Outcomes based on country.
  - Outcomes based on average donation.
